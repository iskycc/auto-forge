# Changelog

All user-visible changes are recorded here. AutoForge follows semantic versioning; release notes must
also list database migrations, persisted-configuration changes, compatibility changes, offline assets,
and known limitations.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Persisted first-start and administrator-managed platform configuration; application settings are no
  longer supplied through environment variables.
- Public live statistics dashboard and desktop-responsive management pages.
- Internal Linux amd64/arm64 Runner Agent resources with SSH installation for Ubuntu and openSUSE.
- Service accounts/API tokens, scheduled suites, notifications, global search, retention operations,
  analytics and asynchronous bounded analytics exports.
- Background JAR imports with progress, cancellation, diagnostics and retry.
- Optional constrained OCI container executor and Agent liveness/readiness commands.
- Offline backup, restore, migration preflight and Runner toolchain packaging helpers.

### Changed

- GitHub Releases publish four backend image variants with embedded Agent resources and no standalone
  Agent binaries.
- JAR and execution-artifact object keys are explicitly scoped by project.

### Database migrations

- SQLite `0015`–`0022`; PostgreSQL `0014`–`0021` add product completion, Runner credential lifecycle,
  execution policy, source comparison metadata, schedule claims, LDAP sync claims, JAR import jobs and
  analytics export jobs.

### Known limitations

- The process executor is not a complete sandbox. The optional container executor depends on a locally
  installed OCI runtime and an administrator-pinned image/seccomp profile.
- Direct terminal sessions require load-balancer affinity to the Web replica that issued the ticket.
- Browser/mobile layouts are not supported; the UI targets desktop screens and narrow desktop windows.
- JDK/TestNG/browser toolchains must be assembled from approved offline artifacts; AutoForge and Agent
  never download them at runtime.
